I'm a PhD student who is passionate about scientific research and contributing to the optimization of the tools used by the community. I am currently a PhD student in C2N lab (University of Paris-Saclay). My research focuses on 2D materials, where I am investigating their optical and electronic properties. I use/develop different programming tools to analyze the experimental data I got. Through GitHub/GitLab platforms, I share some of my projects which I hope will be useful or at least helpful for those who want to start developing new tools.
